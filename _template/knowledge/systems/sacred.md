# SRCL / Sacred Computer

A React/Next.js component library with terminal aesthetics, built around
precise monospace character spacing and line heights.

## What It Is

An open-source component and style repository for building web apps,
desktop apps, and static sites. Terminal-inspired design system with
extreme attention to typographic precision.

## Design Philosophy

- **Precision over decoration.** Every spacing decision is intentional,
  based on character-grid alignment rather than arbitrary values.
- **Monospace grid.** Layout built on fixed-width character spacing and
  exact line heights. The grid is the typography.
- **Terminal aesthetics.** Deliberate evocation of command-line environments
  — not retro nostalgia, but the clarity and density that comes from
  monospace constraint.
- **Modularity.** Components are copy-paste-friendly with minimal
  dependencies. You take what you need, not the whole system.

## What to Learn From It

- **Character-grid spacing**: Spacing derived from character width and
  line height, not arbitrary pixel values. Creates mathematical harmony.
- **Component modularity**: Each component is self-contained. No deep
  dependency chains. Easy to extract and adapt.
- **Minimal dependencies**: The library itself is lightweight. It doesn't
  pull in a framework of frameworks.
- **Density without clutter**: Shows how to present a lot of information
  in a small space while keeping things readable.

## Stack

- React / Next.js
- TypeScript (82% of codebase)
- CSS/SCSS (18%)
- Deployed on Vercel

## When to Reference

- Proposing component architecture or design system decisions
- Working on anything that needs tight typographic control
- Evaluating how to handle information density
- Looking for a reference on monospace-based UI systems
