# Information Architecture

How to organize content, navigation, and structure so users find
what they need without thinking about the system.

## Core Principles

- **Organize for the user's mental model**, not the system's data model.
  Users don't think in database tables.
- **Label in the user's language.** If they call it "projects," don't
  call it "workspaces."
- **Show where I am.** At any point, the user should know: where they
  are, how they got here, and where they can go.
- **Minimize depth.** Broad and shallow beats narrow and deep. Users
  prefer scanning over drilling down.

## Navigation Patterns

- **Global nav**: Persistent. Available everywhere. 5-7 items max.
- **Local nav**: Contextual to the current section. Shows siblings and children.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Show hierarchy path. Useful for deep structures.
- **Search**: Not a substitute for navigation, but a critical supplement.

## Taxonomy

- **Card sorting**: Ask users to group items. Open sort (they name groups)
  or closed sort (you provide categories).
- **Tree testing**: Give users a tree structure and tasks. Can they find
  things without the visual design?
- **Consistent depth**: Similar items should be at similar levels in the hierarchy.

## Content Strategy Basics

- **Audit first**: What content exists? What's missing? What's redundant?
- **One thing per page**: Each page has one primary purpose.
- **Front-load**: Most important information first. Users scan top-down.
- **Chunk**: Break long content into scannable sections with clear headings.

## When to Restructure

Signs the IA isn't working:
- Users can't find things they're looking for
- Same content exists in multiple places
- Navigation labels require explanation
- Support tickets cluster around "where do I find..."
- New features don't have a natural home in the structure
