# Product Thinking

Frameworks for evaluating ideas, prioritizing work, and making product decisions.

## Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

People don't buy products — they "hire" them to do a job.

- **Functional job**: What task are they trying to accomplish?
- **Emotional job**: How do they want to feel?
- **Social job**: How do they want to be perceived?

Ask: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

## Kano Model

Categorize features by user response:

- **Must-be**: Expected. Absence causes dissatisfaction, presence doesn't delight.
  (e.g., login works, pages load)
- **Performance**: More is better. Linear satisfaction. (e.g., speed, storage)
- **Attractive**: Unexpected delight. Absence doesn't hurt, presence surprises.
  (e.g., smart suggestions, beautiful animations)
- **Indifferent**: Users don't care either way. Don't spend time here.
- **Reverse**: Some users actively dislike it. (e.g., auto-playing video)

## Opportunity Scoring

Rate each user need on two axes:
1. **Importance**: How much does this matter to the user?
2. **Satisfaction**: How well does the current solution meet this need?

High importance + low satisfaction = biggest opportunity.

## Decision Framework

When evaluating whether to build something:
1. **Who benefits?** (Which users, how many)
2. **What's the job?** (JTBD framing)
3. **What's the smallest version?** (MVP that validates the hypothesis)
4. **What's the cost of not doing it?** (Risk of inaction)
5. **How will we know it worked?** (Success metric)

## Prioritization

- **Impact vs. effort**: Simple but effective. High impact + low effort first.
- **ICE scoring**: Impact × Confidence × Ease (1-10 each)
- **RICE scoring**: Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort

Don't over-formalize. The frameworks are thinking tools, not scorecards.
