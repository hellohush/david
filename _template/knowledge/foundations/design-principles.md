# Design Principles

## Yours

1. **Clarity over cleverness.** If a user has to think about how to use it, it's wrong.
2. **Copy is interface.** Words do more work than pixels in most products.
3. **If you have to explain it, redesign it.** Documentation is not a substitute for intuition.
4. **Consider the worst day.** Design for the user who's stressed, rushed, or confused — not just the ideal case.
5. **Reduce until it breaks.** Then add back one thing. The minimum that works is usually the right amount.
6. **Show, don't tell.** Prefer demonstrations over descriptions, examples over explanations.

(Add more as you discover them through work.)

### Dieter Rams — 10 Principles of Good Design
- Good design is **innovative** — it doesn't copy, it explores new possibilities
- Good design makes a product **useful** — function over decoration
- Good design is **aesthetic** — well-executed objects affect daily wellbeing
- Good design makes a product **understandable** — the structure explains itself
- Good design is **unobtrusive** — products are tools, not decorations
- Good design is **honest** — doesn't make promises it can't keep
- Good design is **long-lasting** — avoids being fashionable
- Good design is **thorough** down to the last detail
- Good design is **environmentally friendly** — minimal physical and visual waste
- Good design is **as little design as possible** — less, but better

### Key Principles From Practice
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show only what's needed at each step. Advanced options exist but don't clutter the primary experience.
- **Recognition over recall**: Users shouldn't have to remember information from one part of the interface to another.
- **Consistency reduces cognitive load**: Same patterns for same actions, everywhere.
- **Feedback is respect**: Always tell the user what happened, what's happening, and what to do next.
