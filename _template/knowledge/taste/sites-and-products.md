# Sites & Products I Admire

Annotated references for quality calibration. For each: why it's good,
what to steal, and a link.

## Stripe

- **Why**: Data-heavy content presented with life and interactivity.
  Not static charts — things move, respond, teach. Developer docs
  that feel like a product, not an afterthought.
- **Steal**: Their approach to making technical content feel alive.
  The way they use animation to explain concepts. Documentation
  as a first-class product surface.
- **Link**: https://stripe.com

## Linear

- **Why**: Opinionated product that respects power users without
  sacrificing clarity for new ones. Keyboard-first interaction model.
  Beautiful execution of a productivity tool.
- **Steal**: How they handle information density — lots of data,
  zero clutter. Their empty states are better than most filled states.
  The feeling of speed in every interaction.

## Sacred Computer (SRCL)

- **Why**: Pixel-precise terminal aesthetics executed with extreme care.
  Monospace character-grid spacing creates mathematical harmony. Proof
  that constraints (monospace only) can produce beauty.
- **Steal**: The discipline of character-grid-based spacing. Component
  modularity with minimal dependencies. Density without clutter.

## Vercel

- **Why**: Their Web Interface Guidelines are the gold standard for
  frontend quality. The product itself is fast, clear, and respects
  developer workflows.
- **Steal**: The guidelines themselves (see craft/web-interface-guidelines.md).
  Their approach to progressive disclosure in complex dashboards.
  How they handle deployment status and real-time feedback.
