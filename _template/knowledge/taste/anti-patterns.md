# Anti-Patterns

Things that are bad and why. Use these to catch problems in reviews.

---

## Dark Patterns
- **Confirm-shaming**: "No thanks, I don't want to save money." Manipulative
  and erodes trust.
- **Hidden unsubscribe**: Making it hard to cancel or unsubscribe. Users
  remember and resent it.
- **Forced continuity**: Free trial that auto-converts without clear warning.

## UX Mistakes
- **Mystery meat navigation**: Icons without labels. Users shouldn't guess
  what things do.
- **Infinite scroll without position awareness**: No way to know how far
  you are, no way to return to a specific spot.
- **Modal on modal**: Stacking dialogs. If you need a modal inside a modal,
  rethink the flow.
- **Disabled buttons without explanation**: The user can see it but can't
  use it and doesn't know why.
- **Auto-playing anything**: Video, audio, carousels. Respect the user's
  attention and data.

## Copy Mistakes
- **"Oops!"** in error messages: Dismissive. The user has a problem;
  don't be cute about it.
- **"Are you sure?"** without restating the action: Sure about what?
  Always specify: "Delete this project? This can't be undone."
- **"Invalid input"**: What's invalid? What should they enter instead?
- **"Something went wrong"**: What? What should they do? Be specific.
- **Overuse of "please"**: Once per flow is enough. More sounds desperate.

## Design Mistakes
- **Everything is the same size/weight**: No hierarchy means no guidance.
- **Centered text blocks**: Hard to scan. Left-align body text.
- **Low-contrast placeholder text**: Users can't read it. It's either
  important enough to be legible or it shouldn't be there.
- **Hover-only information**: Doesn't work on touch devices. Don't hide
  critical information behind hover.
- **Truncation without access to full content**: Ellipsis with no way
  to see the rest.
