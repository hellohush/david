# Copy Examples

Great UX copy worth studying. Annotated with why it works.

---

## Error Messages

**Stripe**: "Your card was declined. Try a different payment method."
- Why: States the problem, offers the solution. No blame, no jargon.

**GitHub**: "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved."
- Why: States the fact, implies the action. Doesn't panic.

## Empty States

**Linear**: "No issues match your filter. Try adjusting your search or create a new issue."
- Why: Acknowledges the situation, offers two paths forward.

**Notion**: A gentle illustration with "This page is empty. Click anywhere to start writing."
- Why: Inviting, not clinical. The instruction is the interface.

## Buttons & CTAs

**Vercel**: "Deploy" (not "Submit deployment")
- Why: One word, clear action. The context makes the object obvious.

**Stripe**: "Start accepting payments" (not "Set up Stripe")
- Why: Describes the user's goal, not the system's process.

## Confirmation Messages

**Linear**: "Issue moved to Done."
- Why: Confirms what happened in the user's language. No "Success!"

## Microcopy

**Stripe**: "Test mode — no real charges will be made."
- Why: Reduces anxiety. One line, exactly when you need it.
