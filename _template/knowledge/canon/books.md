# Books

Key takeaways from design books. The agent doesn't need to have read the
book — it needs to know the principles well enough to apply them.

## "Don't Make Me Think" — Steve Krug

**Key ideas**:
- Users don't read, they scan. Design for scanning.
- The "trunk test": Can you tell where you are on any page? What site
  is this? What are the major sections? Where am I in the hierarchy?
  How can I search?
- Usability testing with even a few people reveals most major issues.

**Apply when**: Reviewing any new screen or flow. Evaluating navigation.

## "Articulating Design Decisions" — Tom Greever

**Key ideas**:
- Design rationale matters more than the design itself when presenting
  to stakeholders.
- Always connect your decision to a user outcome, not an aesthetic
  preference. "This helps users because..." not "This looks better."
- Understand stakeholder concerns before presenting — anticipate objections.

**Apply when**: Drafting client messages, preparing design reviews,
explaining design choices to non-designers.
