# Visual Hierarchy

How to guide the eye, establish importance, and create layouts that
communicate before they're read.

## Hierarchy Tools

In order of strength (strongest first):
1. **Size** — Larger elements are seen first
2. **Color / Contrast** — High contrast draws attention
3. **Weight** — Bold text stands out from regular
4. **Position** — Top-left (in LTR) gets seen first; center for focus
5. **Whitespace** — Isolation creates importance
6. **Proximity** — Grouped items are perceived as related

## The Squint Test

Squint at the screen. Can you still tell:
- What's the most important thing?
- What's the primary action?
- What are the distinct groups of content?

If not, the hierarchy isn't working.

## Typography

- **Limit to 2-3 sizes** per screen. More creates chaos.
- **Use weight, not size** to differentiate within a level.
- **Line length**: 45-75 characters for body text. Shorter for scanning contexts.
- **Line height**: 1.4-1.6 for body text. Tighter for headings (1.1-1.3).
- **Paragraph spacing**: More than line spacing, less than section spacing.

## Spacing Systems

- Use a consistent scale: 4px base (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64)
- **Internal spacing** (padding) should be less than **external spacing** (margin)
- Groups of related items: tight spacing. Between groups: generous spacing.
- Whitespace is not wasted space — it's a hierarchy tool.

## Layout Principles

- **Alignment creates relationships.** Elements that align feel connected.
- **Grids create order.** Use them, but break them intentionally.
- **F-pattern for content pages**: Users scan left-to-right, then down the left side.
- **Z-pattern for landing pages**: Top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right.
- **One primary action per screen.** If everything is important, nothing is.

## Color for Hierarchy

- **Primary action**: Your brand's accent color. One per screen.
- **Secondary actions**: Muted, lower contrast.
- **Destructive actions**: Red, but not the loudest element on screen.
- **Disabled states**: Reduced opacity, not just grayed out.
- **Backgrounds**: Use subtle differences to create depth and grouping.

## Common Mistakes

- Making everything bold
- Too many competing colors
- Equal spacing everywhere (no rhythm)
- Centering everything (loses alignment relationships)
- Tiny margins between unrelated elements
