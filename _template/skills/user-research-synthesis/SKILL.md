# User Research Synthesis

## Knowledge

Before synthesizing, ground yourself in:
- knowledge/foundations/product-thinking.md
- knowledge/foundations/design-principles.md

## Process

### 1. Organize the Raw Data

Before interpreting anything:
- What type of data is this? (Interviews, surveys, analytics, feedback, usability tests?)
- How many participants/data points?
- What was the research question or goal?

### 2. Separate the Layers

For each data point, distinguish:
- **Observation**: What actually happened or was said. Direct quotes, behaviors, numbers.
- **Interpretation**: What it means. Your read on the "why."
- **Recommendation**: What to do about it. The design implication.

Keep these separate. Don't let interpretation masquerade as observation.

### 3. Find Patterns

Look for themes that appear across multiple participants or data points.
Ask:
- Is this one person's issue or a pattern across several?
- How many people showed this behavior or expressed this sentiment?
- Are there clusters — groups of related observations that form a story?

### 4. Flag Contradictions

Contradictions in the data are often the most interesting findings.
When users say one thing but do another, or when two groups have
opposing needs — call it out. Don't smooth it over.

### 5. Produce the Insight Summary

For each theme:

**Theme** → **Evidence** → **Implication** → **Opportunity**

- **Theme**: The pattern you identified (1 sentence)
- **Evidence**: Supporting data points (quotes, numbers, behaviors)
- **Implication**: What this means for the product (1–2 sentences)
- **Opportunity**: What to do about it (specific design direction)

### 6. What Surprised Us

End with a "surprises" section. What was unexpected? What challenged
existing assumptions? These are often the most valuable findings.

## Output Format

```
## Research Summary
**Source**: [type of research, N participants]
**Question**: [what we were trying to learn]

## Key Insights

### Insight 1: [Theme Name]
**Evidence**: [2–3 supporting data points]
**Implication**: [what this means]
**Opportunity**: [what to do]

...

## Contradictions
- [Where the data conflicts and why it's interesting]

## Surprises
- [What was unexpected]

## Open Questions
- [What we still don't know]
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't cherry-pick quotes** that support a pre-existing hypothesis.
  Let the data lead.
- **Don't present frequency as significance.** 3 people saying something
  loudly is not a trend. Note the sample size.
- **Don't skip "what surprised us."** Surprises are often the most
  valuable findings.
- **Don't collapse nuance.** If a finding is complicated, say so.
  Don't simplify it into a false clarity.
- **Don't make recommendations without evidence.** Every "we should"
  needs a "because users showed us."
