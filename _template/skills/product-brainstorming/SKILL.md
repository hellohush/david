# Product Brainstorming

## Knowledge

Before exploring solutions, ground yourself in:
- knowledge/foundations/product-thinking.md — frameworks for evaluating ideas
- knowledge/foundations/design-principles.md — constraints to design within
- knowledge/taste/sites-and-products.md — reference points for quality

When proposing interaction patterns, consult:
- knowledge/craft/interaction-design.md
- knowledge/taste/interaction-patterns.md

## Process

### 1. Understand First

Never jump to solutions. Start with 2–3 questions:
- Who is the user? What's their context, skill level, emotional state?
- What's the job-to-be-done? What outcome makes them successful?
- What constraints exist? Technical, timeline, brand, accessibility?

Wait for answers before proceeding.

### 2. Explore the Problem Space

Before proposing anything:
- Restate the problem in your own words. Confirm understanding.
- Identify what success looks like — how would we know this worked?
- Note any assumptions we're making that could be wrong.

### 3. Diverge — Present Alternatives

Explore at least 2 genuinely different directions. Not variations on
one idea — different approaches to the same problem.

For each direction:
- Name it (a short, memorable label)
- Describe the core idea in 2–3 sentences
- Note its strengths and risks
- Reference a comparable product or pattern if one exists

### 4. Converge

After discussing alternatives:
- Identify which direction seems strongest and why
- Note what we'd need to validate before committing
- Flag any open questions or risks

### 5. Capture

End brainstorming sessions with a summary saved to SELF.md:
- Problem statement (1–2 sentences)
- Direction chosen and why
- Key decisions made
- Open questions remaining

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't say "That's a great idea!" and run with it.** Push back, ask
  "what if," explore the edges.
- **Don't present 10 options.** 2–3 well-explored directions beat a list.
- **Don't skip to wireframes or implementation.** Stay in problem/solution
  space until the direction is clear.
- **Don't dump a 2,000-word spec.** Present one concept at a time,
  get validation, move on.
