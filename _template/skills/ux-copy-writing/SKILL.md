# UX Copy Writing

## Knowledge

Before writing, read:
- knowledge/craft/ux-writing.md — patterns and word lists
- knowledge/voices/ — load the relevant voice guide for this project
- knowledge/taste/copy-examples.md — calibrate quality bar

If the user references a specific product or principle, check:
- knowledge/canon/articles.md
- knowledge/foundations/design-principles.md

## Process

### 1. Understand the Context

Before writing a single word, ask:
- What's the user doing right now?
- What just happened? (What action or event brought them here?)
- What do they need to do next?
- What are they likely feeling? (Confident? Confused? Frustrated? Relieved?)

### 2. Write With the Hierarchy

Follow this order. Never sacrifice an earlier level for a later one.

1. **Clarity** — Can the user understand what's happening and what to do?
2. **Brevity** — Can you say it in fewer words without losing clarity?
3. **Tone** — Does it match the emotional context and the product voice?
4. **Personality** — Can you add character without sacrificing the above?

### 3. Produce Three Variants

For each piece of copy, offer three options:

- **Safe**: Clear and neutral. Works for any brand.
- **Concise**: The tightest possible version. Every word earns its place.
- **Personality**: Has character and warmth. Still clear.

Explain the tradeoff in each.

### 4. Run the Checklist

For every draft, check:
- [ ] No jargon or technical terms the user wouldn't know
- [ ] No passive voice (unless intentional for tone)
- [ ] No ambiguity — one possible interpretation only
- [ ] No anxiety-inducing language ("Warning!", "Are you sure?", "This cannot be undone" without explaining what happens)
- [ ] Consistent with the product's voice guide

### 5. The One-String Test

Ask: "If the user only reads this one string, do they know what to do?"
If not, rewrite.

## Patterns

### Error Messages
Structure: What happened → Why → What to do next.
Never blame the user.

### Buttons
Say what happens when you click, not "Submit" or "OK."
- Not: "Submit" → "Create account"
- Not: "OK" → "Got it" or "Continue"
- Not: "Cancel" → "Never mind" or "Go back"

### Empty States
An empty state is an opportunity, not a dead end.
Say what goes here and how to get started.

### Confirmations
Confirm the action that happened, not that something was "successful."
- Not: "Success!" → "Your changes are saved."
- Not: "Email sent successfully." → "We sent a confirmation to hannah@example.com."

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't write "Oops!" in error messages.** It's dismissive.
- **Don't use "please" in every instruction.** Once is enough. Overuse
  sounds desperate or passive-aggressive.
- **Don't write buttons that say "Submit"** when you can say what
  actually happens.
- **Don't assume the user knows your product's terminology.**
