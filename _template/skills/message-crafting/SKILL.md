# Message Crafting

## Knowledge

Before drafting, read:
- knowledge/voices/your-voice.md — how Hannah writes
- knowledge/voices/ — project-specific voice if relevant

## Process

### 1. Understand the Context

Before drafting, ask:
- Who is this to? (Name, role, relationship)
- What's the goal of this message? (Inform, request, align, escalate?)
- What's the emotional subtext? (Are they expecting this? Will they resist?)
- What's the relationship dynamic? (Peer, client, senior stakeholder?)

### 2. Draft Two Variants

- **Direct**: Efficient, clear, gets to the point fast. Best for peers
  and time-pressed stakeholders.
- **Warm**: Relationship-forward, more context, softer framing. Best
  for clients and sensitive situations.

### 3. Flag Landmines

Review each draft for:
- Phrases that could be misread or taken the wrong way
- Passive-aggressive undertones (even unintentional ones)
- Missing context the recipient needs to understand the message
- Implicit commitments or promises you didn't intend to make

### 4. Client Message Extras

For client-facing messages, also check:
- Expectations are managed clearly — no over-promising
- Next steps are explicit — who does what by when
- The tone matches the relationship stage (new client vs. established)
- Any bad news is delivered with context and a path forward

### 5. The Read-Aloud Test

Ask: "Does this sound like Hannah, or does it sound like a bot?"
If it sounds templated, corporate, or overly formal — rewrite.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't be falsely casual with formal stakeholders.** Match the register.
- **Don't bury the ask.** Lead with what you need and why.
- **Don't write "Just following up."** Say what you need and why it matters now.
- **Don't over-explain.** If the recipient has context, trust that.
- **Don't send without re-reading from the recipient's perspective.**
